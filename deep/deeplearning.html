# Deep Learning for Beginners

Notes for "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

## Machine Learning

* Machine learning is a branch of statistics that uses samples to approximate functions.
  * We have a true underlying function that generates data, but we don't know what this function is.
  * We can sample this function, and these samples form our training data.
  * For example: in image captioning, the function we want converts an image into a textual description, the samples are images with descriptions.
* The goal then, is to find techniques that will:
  * Find a good candidate approximation that fits the training data well,
  * This solution must also generalize to unseen data as well.
  * For example: storing all training data and returning the nearest match can be a reasonable technique (it's called clustering).
* Machine learning lets us solve problems we don't have a good theory for, because the machine learns the theory.
* Possible applications of machine learning:
  * Convert inputs into another form - learn "relevance", extract it and express it. eg: image classification, image captioning.
  * Predict the missing or future values of a sequence - learn "causality", and predict it.
  * Synthesise similar outputs - learn "structure", and generate it.

## Generalization and Overfitting.

* Overfitting is when you have found good solutions to the training data, but it doesn't generalize.
  * It is like a student who has memorized the answers to the exercise book so score well on mock tests, but score badly on novel tests.
* The standard technique is to do cross validation:
  * Set aside "test data" which is never trained upon.
  * After training is complete, we run the solution on the test data.
* One tension that exists is that powerful models simultaneously can solve more problems, but also have more leeway for overfitting.
* Deep learning is one branch of machine learning techniques. It is a powerful model that has also been successful at generalizing.

## Feedforward Networks

Feedforward networks approximates your function $y = f^\star(x)$ with a function family: $$ u = f(\theta)(x) $$

* $\theta$ are the model parameters. This could be thousands or millions of parameters $\theta_1 \ldots \theta_T$.
* $f$ is a family of functions. $f(\theta)$ is a single function. $u$ is the output of the model.
* You can imagine if you chose a sufficiently general family of functions, chances are, one of them will resemble $f^\star$.
* For example: let the parameters represent a matrix and a vector:
  $f(\theta)(\vec{x}) = \begin{bmatrix}\theta_0 & \theta_1 \\\\ \theta_2 & \theta_3\end{bmatrix} \vec{x} + \begin{bmatrix}\theta_4 \\\\ \theta_5 \end{bmatrix}$

## Designing the Output Layer.

The most common output layer is: $$f(x) = g(Mx+b)$$

* The linear part $Mx+b$ ensures that your output depends on all inputs.
* The nonlinear part $g(x)$ allows you to fit the distributon of $y$.
* For example for input of photos, the output distribution could be:
  * Linear: $y \in \mathbb{R}$. eg cuteness of the photo
  * Sigmoid: $y \in [0, 1]$. eg probability its a cat
  * Softmax: $y \in \mathbb{R}^C$ and $\sum y = 1$. eg. probability its one of $C$ breeds of cats
* To ensure $g(x)$ fits the distribution, you can use:
  * Linear: $g(x) = x$.
  * Sigmoid: $g(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^x}$.

    <img src="sigmoid.svg" style="margin: 0; width: 10em">
  * Softmax: $g(x)_c = \frac{e^{x_c}}{\sum_i e^{x_i}}$.
* Softmax is actually under-constrained, and often $x_0$ is set to 1. In this case sigmoid is just softmax in 2 variables.
* There is theory behind why these $g$'s are good choices, but there are many different choices.

## Finding $\theta$

Find $\theta$ by solving the following optimization problem for $J$ the cost function:

$$ \min_{\theta \in \text{models}} J\big( y, f(\theta)(x) \big) $$

* Deep learning is successful because there is a good family of algorithms to calculate $\min$.
* That algorithms are all variations of gradient descent:
```
theta = initial_random_values()
loop {
    xs = fetch_inputs()
    ys = fetch_outputs()
    us = model(theta)(xs)
    cost = J(ys, us)
    if cost < threshold: exit;
    theta = theta - gradient(cost)
}
```
* Intuitively, at every theta you chose the direction that reduces the cost the most.
* This requires you to compute the gradient $\frac{d\text{cost}}{d\theta_t}$.
* You don't want the gradient to be near $0$ because you learn too slowly or near $\inf$ because it is not stable.
* This is a greedy algorithm, and thus might converge but into a local minimum.

## Chosing the Cost Function

* This cost function could be anything:
  * Sum of absolute errors: $J = \sum|y - u|$.
  * Sum of square errors: $J = \sum(y - u)^2$.
* One good idea is that $u$ represents the parameters of the distribution of $y$.
  * Rationale: often natural processes are fuzzy, and any input might have a range of outputs.
  * This approach also gives a smooth measure of how accurate we are.
  * The maximum likelihood principle says that: $\theta\_\text{most likely} = \arg\max_\theta p(y; u)$
  * Thus we want to minimize: $J = -p(y; u)$
  * For $i$ samples: $J = -\prod_i p(y_i; u)$
  * Taking log both sides: $J' = -\sum_i \log p(y_i; u)$.
  * This is called cross-entropy.
* Applying the idea for: $y \sim \text{Gaussian}(\text{center}=u)$:
  * $p(y; u) = e^{-(y-u)^2}.$
  * $J = -\sum \log e^{-(y-u)^2} = \sum(y-u)^2$
  * This motivates sum of squares as a good choice.

## Deep Feedforward Networks

Deep feedforward networks instead use: $$ u = f(\theta)(x) = f^N(\theta^N)(\ldots(f^2(\theta^2)(f^1(\theta^1)(x)))) $$

* This model has $N$ layers.
  * $f^1 \ldots f^{N-1}$: hidden layers.
  * $f^N$: output layer.
* A deep model sounds like a bad idea because it needs more parameters.
* In practise, it actually needs fewer parameters, and the models perform better (why?).
* One possible reason is that each layer learns higher and higher level features of the data.

## Designing Hidden Layers.

The most common hidden layer is: $$f^n(x) = g(Mx+b)$$

* The hidden layers have the same structure as the output layer.
* However the $g(x)$ which work well for the output layer don't work well for the hidden layers.
* The simplest and most successful $g$ is the rectified linear unit (ReLU): $g(x) = \max(0, x)$.
  * Compared to sigmoid, the gradients of ReLU does not approach zero when x is very big.
* Other common non-linear functions include:
* Modulated ReLU: $g(x) = \max(0, x) + \alpha\min(0, x)$.
  * Where alpha is -1, very small, or a model parameter itself.
  * The intuition is that this function has a slope for x &lt; 0.
  * In practise there is no absolute winner between this and ReLU.
* Maxout: $g(x)\_i = \max_{j \in G(i)} x_j$
  * For comparison ReLU is $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, and maxout is $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^\frac{n}{m}$.
  * It is the max of each bundle of $m$ inputs, think of it as $m$ piecewise linear sections.
* Linear: $g(x) = x$
  * After multiplying with the next layer up, it is equivalent to: $f^n(x) = g'(NMx+b')$
  * It's useful because you can use use narrow $N$ and $M$, which has less parameters.

## Regularization

* Regularization techniques are methods that attempt to reduce generalization error.
  * It is not meant to improve the training error.
* Prefer smaller $\theta$ values:
  * By adding some function of $\theta$ into $J$ we can encourage small parameters.
  * $L^2$: $J' = J + \sum |\theta|^2$
  * $L^1$: $J' = J + \sum |\theta|$
  * $L^0$ is not smooth.
  * Note for $\theta \rightarrow Mx+b$ usually only $M$ is added.
* Data augmentation:
  * Having more examples reduces overfitting.
  * Also consider generating valid new data from existing data.
  * Rotation, stretch existing images to make new images.
  * Injecting small noise into $x$, into layers, into parameters.
* Multi-Task learning:
  * Share a layer between several different tasks.
  * The layer is forced to chose useful features that is relevant to a general set of tasks.
* Early stopping:
  * Keep a test data set, called the validation set, that is never trained on
  * Stop training when the cost on the validation set stops decreasing.
  * You need an extra test set to truly judge the the final.
* Parameter sharing:
  * If you know invariants about your data, encode that into your parameter choice.
  * For example: images are translationally invariant, so each small patch should have the same parameters.
* Dropout:
  * Randomly turn off some neurons in the layer.
  * Neurons learn to not take input data for granted.
* Adversarial:
  * Try to make the points near training points constant, by generating adversarial data near these points.

## Optimizaton Methods

* Minibatch - TODO
* Why is it stochastic?? - TODO
* There are many ways to do gradient descent (using: gradient $g$, learning rate $\epsilon$, gradient update $\Delta$)
  * Gradient descent - use gradient: $\Delta = \epsilon g$.
  * Momentum - use exponential decayed gradient: $\Delta = \epsilon \sum e^{-t} g_t$.
  * Adaptive learning rate where $\epsilon = \epsilon_t$:
    * AdaGrad - slow learning on gradient magnitude: $\epsilon_t = \frac{\epsilon}{\delta + \sqrt{\sum g_t^2}}$.
    * RMSProp - slow learning on exponentially decayed gradient magnitude: $\epsilon_t = \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{\delta + \sum e^{-t} g_t^2}}$.
    * Adam - complicated.
* Newton's method: it's hard to apply due to technical reasons.

## Simplifying the Network

* 

## Convolution Networks

Convolutional networks are ones where some layers use convolution instead of matrix multiply: $$ s(t) = \int{x(a)y(t-a)\,da} = (x \ast y)(t) $$

* It captures locality, and is used for 1d, 2d, and 3d data where locality is a useful signal.
* It captures location invariance as the same parameters are used.
* Pooling: zzz
