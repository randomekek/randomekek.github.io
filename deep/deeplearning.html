# Deep Learning for Beginners

Notes for "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

## Machine Learning

* Machine learning is a branch of statistics that uses samples to approximate functions.
  * We have a true underlying function or distribution that generates data, but we don't know what it is.
  * We can sample this function, and these samples form our training data.
* Example image captioning:
  * Function: $f^\star(\text{image}) \rightarrow \text{description}$.
  * Samples: $\text{data} \in (\text{image}, \text{description})$.
  * Note: since there are many valid descriptions, the description is a distribution in text space: $\text{description} \sim \text{Text}$.
* The goal of machine is to find models that:
  * Have enough representation power to closely approximate the true function.
  * Have an efficient algorithm that uses training data to find good approximations of the function.
  * And the approximation must generalize to return good outputs for unseen inputs.
* Possible applications of machine learning:
  * Convert inputs into another form - learn "information", extract it and express it. eg: image classification, image captioning.
  * Predict the missing or future values of a sequence - learn "causality", and predict it.
  * Synthesise similar outputs - learn "structure", and generate it.

## Generalization and Overfitting.

<img src="overfitting.png" style="margin: 0; width: 20em">

* Overfitting is when you find a good model of the training data, but this model doesn't generalize.
  * For example: a student who has memorized the answers to training tests will score well on a training test, but might scores badly on the final test.
* There are several tradeoffs:
  * Model representation capacity: a weak model cannot model the function but a powerful model is more prone to overfitting.
  * Training iterations: training too little doesn't give enough time to fit the function, training too much gives more time to overfit.
  * You need to find a middle ground between a weak model and an overfitted model.
* The standard technique is to do cross validation:
  * Set aside "test data" which is never trained upon.
  * After all training is complete, we run the model on the final test data.
  * You cannot tweak the model after the final test (of course you can gather more data).
  * If training the model happens in stages, you need to withhold test data for each stage.
* Deep learning is one branch of machine learning techniques. It is a powerful model that has also been successful at generalizing.

## Feedforward Networks

Feedforward networks represents $y = f^\star(x)$ with a function family:
$$ u = f(x; \theta) $$

* $\theta$ are the model parameters. This could be thousands or millions of parameters $\theta_1 \ldots \theta_T$.
* $f$ is a family of functions. $f(x; \theta)$ is a single function of $x$. $u$ is the output of the model.
* You can imagine if you chose a sufficiently general family of functions, chances are, one of them will resemble $f^\star$.
* For example: let the parameters represent a matrix and a vector:
  $f(\vec{x}; \theta)() = \begin{bmatrix}\theta_0 & \theta_1 \\\\ \theta_2 & \theta_3\end{bmatrix} \vec{x} + \begin{bmatrix}\theta_4 \\\\ \theta_5 \end{bmatrix}$

## Designing the Output Layer.

The most common output layer is:
$$f(x; M, b) = g(Mx+b)$$

* The parameters in $\theta$ are used as $M$ and $b$.
* The linear part $Mx+b$ ensures that your output depends on all inputs.
* The nonlinear part $g(x)$ allows you to fit the distributon of $y$.
* For example for input of photos, the output distribution could be:
  * Linear: $y \in \mathbb{R}$. eg cuteness of the photo
  * Sigmoid: $y \in [0, 1]$. eg probability its a cat
  * Softmax: $y \in \mathbb{R}^C$ and $\sum y = 1$. eg. probability its one of $C$ breeds of cats
* To ensure $g(x)$ fits the distribution, you can use:
  * Linear: $g(x) = x$.
  * Sigmoid: $g(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$.

    <img src="sigmoid.svg" style="margin: 0; width: 10em">
  * Softmax: $g(x)_c = \frac{e^{x_c}}{\sum_i e^{x_i}}$.
* Softmax is actually under-constrained, and often $x_0$ is set to 1. In this case sigmoid is just softmax in 2 variables.
* There is theory behind why these $g$'s are good choices, but there are many different choices.

## Finding $\theta$

Find $\theta$ by solving the following optimization problem for $J$ the cost function:

$$ \min_{\theta \in \text{models}} J\big( y, f(x; \theta) \big) $$

* Deep learning is successful because there is a good family of algorithms to calculate $\min$.
* That algorithms are all variations of gradient descent:
```
theta = initial_random_values()
loop {
    xs = fetch_inputs()
    ys = fetch_outputs()
    us = model(theta)(xs)
    cost = J(ys, us)
    if cost < threshold: exit;
    theta = theta - gradient(cost)
}
```
* Intuitively, at every $\theta$ you chose the direction that reduces the cost the most.
* This requires you to compute the gradient $\frac{d\text{cost}}{d\theta_t}$.
* You don't want the gradient to be near $0$ because you learn too slowly or near $\inf$ because it is not stable.
* This is a greedy algorithm, and thus might converge but into a local minimum.

## Choosing the Cost Function

* This cost function could be anything:
  * Sum of absolute errors: $J = \sum|y - u|$.
  * Sum of square errors: $J = \sum(y - u)^2$.
  * As long as the minimum occurs when the distributions are the same, in theory it would work.
* One good idea is that $u$ represents the parameters of the distribution of $y$.
  * Rationale: often natural processes are fuzzy, and any input might have a range of outputs.
  * This approach also gives a smooth measure of how accurate we are.
  * The maximum likelihood principle says that: $\theta\_\text{ML} = \arg\max_\theta p(y; u)$
  * Thus we want to minimize: $J = -p(y; u)$
  * For $i$ samples: $J = -\prod_i p(y_i; u)$
  * Taking log both sides: $J' = -\sum_i \log p(y_i; u)$.
  * This is called cross-entropy.
* Applying the idea for: $y \sim \text{Gaussian}(\text{center}=u)$:
  * $p(y; u) = e^{-(y-u)^2}.$
  * $J = -\sum \log e^{-(y-u)^2} = \sum(y-u)^2$
  * This motivates sum of squares as a good choice.

## Regularization

* Regularization techniques are methods that attempt to reduce generalization error.
  * It is not meant to improve the training error.
* Prefer smaller $\theta$ values:
  * By adding some function of $\theta$ into $J$ we can encourage small parameters.
  * $L^2$: $J' = J + \sum |\theta|^2$
  * $L^1$: $J' = J + \sum |\theta|$
  * $L^0$ is not smooth.
  * Note for $\theta \rightarrow Mx+b$ usually only $M$ is added.
* Data augmentation:
  * Having more examples reduces overfitting.
  * Also consider generating valid new data from existing data.
  * Rotation, stretch existing images to make new images.
  * Injecting small noise into $x$, into layers, into parameters.
* Multi-Task learning:
  * Share a layer between several different tasks.
  * The layer is forced to choose useful features that is relevant to a general set of tasks.
* Early stopping:
  * Keep a test data set, called the validation set, that is never trained on
  * Stop training when the cost on the validation set stops decreasing.
  * You need an extra test set to truly judge the the final.
* Parameter sharing:
  * If you know invariants about your data, encode that into your parameter choice.
  * For example: images are translationally invariant, so each small patch should have the same parameters.
* Dropout:
  * Randomly turn off some neurons in the layer.
  * Neurons learn to not take input data for granted.
* Adversarial:
  * Try to make the points near training points constant, by generating adversarial data near these points.

## Deep Feedforward Networks

Deep feedforward networks instead use: 
$$ u = f(x, \theta) = f^N(\ldots f^1(x; \theta^1) \ldots; \theta^N) $$

* This model has $N$ layers.
  * $f^1 \ldots f^{N-1}$: hidden layers.
  * $f^N$: output layer.
* A deep model sounds like a bad idea because it needs more parameters.
* In practise, it actually needs fewer parameters, and the models perform better (why?).
* One possible reason is that each layer learns higher and higher level features of the data.
* Residual models: $f'^n(x) = f^n(x) + x^{n-1}$.
  * Data can come from the past, we add on some more details to it.

## Designing Hidden Layers.

The most common hidden layer is:
$$f^n(x) = g(Mx+b)$$

* The hidden layers have the same structure as the output layer.
* However the $g(x)$ which work well for the output layer don't work well for the hidden layers.
* The simplest and most successful $g$ is the rectified linear unit (ReLU): $g(x) = \max(0, x)$.
  * Compared to sigmoid, the gradients of ReLU does not approach zero when x is very big.
* Other common non-linear functions include:
* Modulated ReLU: $g(x) = \max(0, x) + \alpha\min(0, x)$.
  * Where alpha is -1, very small, or a model parameter itself.
  * The intuition is that this function has a slope for x &lt; 0.
  * In practise there is no absolute winner between this and ReLU.
* Maxout: $g(x)\_i = \max_{j \in G(i)} x_j$
  * $G$ partitions the range $[1 .. I]$ into subsets $[1 .. m], [m+1 .. 2m], [I-m .. I]$.
  * For comparison ReLU is $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, and maxout is $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^\frac{n}{m}$.
  * It is the max of each bundle of $m$ inputs, think of it as $m$ piecewise linear sections.
* Linear: $g(x) = x$
  * After multiplying with the next layer up, it is equivalent to: $f^n(x) = g'(NMx+b')$
  * It's useful because you can use use narrow $N$ and $M$, which has less parameters.

## Optimizaton Methods

* The methods we use is based on stochastic gradient descent:
  * Choose a subset of the training data (a minibatch), and calculate the gradient from that.
  * Benefit: does not depend on training set size, but on minibatch size.
* There are many ways to do gradient descent (using: gradient $g$, learning rate $\epsilon$, gradient update $\Delta$)
  * Gradient descent - use gradient: $\Delta = \epsilon g$.
  * Momentum - use exponential decayed gradient: $\Delta = \epsilon \sum e^{-t} g_t$.
  * Adaptive learning rate where $\epsilon = \epsilon_t$:
    * AdaGrad - slow learning on gradient magnitude: $\epsilon_t = \frac{\epsilon}{\delta + \sqrt{\sum g_t^2}}$.
    * RMSProp - slow learning on exponentially decayed gradient magnitude: $\epsilon_t = \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{\delta + \sum e^{-t} g_t^2}}$.
    * Adam - complicated.
* Newton's method: it's hard to apply due to technical reasons.
* Batch normalization is a layer with the transform: $y = m\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} + b$
  * $m$ and $b$ are learnable, while $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are average and standard deviation.
  * This means that the layers can be fully independent (assume the distribution of the previous layer).
* Curriculum learning: provide easier things to learn first then mix harder things in.

## Simplifying the Network

* At this point, we have enough basis to design and optimize deep networks.
* However, these models are very general and large.
  * If your network has $N$ layers each with $S$ inputs/outputs, the parameter space is $|\theta| = O(NS^2)$.
  * This has two downsides: overfitting, and longer training time.
* There are many methods to reduce parameter space:
  * Find symmetries in the problem and choose layers that are invariant about the symmetry.
  * Create layers with lower output dimensionality, the network must summarize information into a more compact representation.

## Convolution Networks

A convolutional network simplifies some layers by using convolution instead of matrix multiply (denoted with a star):
$$ f^n(x) = g(\theta^n \ast x) $$

* It is used for data that is spatially distributed, and works for 1d, 2d and 3d data.
  * 1d: $(\theta \ast x)\_i = \sum\_a \theta\_a x\_{i+a}$
  * 2d: $(\theta \ast x)\_{ij} = \sum\_a \sum\_b \theta\_{ab} x\_{ab+ij}$
* It's slightly from the mathematical definition, but has the same idea: the output at each point is a weighted sum of nearby points.
* Benefits:
  * Captures the notion of locality, if $\theta$ is zero, except in a window $w$ wide near $i=0$.
  * Captures the notion of translation invariance, as the same $\theta$ are used for each point.
  * Reduces the number of model parameters from $O(S^2)$, to $O(w^2)$.
* If there are $n$ layers of convolution, one base value will be able to influence the outputs in a $wn$ radius.
* Practical considerations:
  * Pad the edges with 0, and how far to pad.
  * Tiled convolutions (you rotate between different convolutions).

## Pooling

A common layer used in unison with convnets is max pooling:
$$ f^n(x)\_i = \max\_{j \in G(i)} x_j $$

* It is the same structure as maxout, and equivalent in 1d.
* For higher dimensions $G$ partitions the input space into tiles.
* This reduces the size of the input data, and can be considered as collapsing a local region of the inputs into a summary.
* It is also invariant to small translations.

## Recurrent Networks

Recurrent networks use previous outputs as inputs, forming a recurrence:
$$ s^{(t)} = f(s^{(t-1)}, x^{(t)}; \theta) $$

* The state $s$ contains a summary of the past, while $x$ is the inputs that arrive at each step.
* It is a simpler model than a fully dynamic: $s^{(t)} = d^{(t)}(x^{(t)}, ... x^{(1)}; \theta')$
  * All the $\theta$'s are shared across time - the recurrent network assumes time invariance.
  * A RNN can learn for any input length, while a fully dynamic model needs a different $g$ for each input length.
* Output: the model may return $y^{(t)}$ at each time step:
  * No output during steps, only the final state matters. Eg: sentiment analysis.
  * $y^{(t)} = s^{(t)}$, the model has no internal state and thus less powerful. But it is easier to train, since the training data $y$ is just $s$.
  * $y^{(t)} = o(s^{(t)})$, use an output layer to transform (and hide) the internal state. But training is more indirect and harder.
  * As always we prefer to think of $y$ as the parameters to a distribution.
* The output chosen may be fed back to $f$ as extra inputs. If not fed in, the $y$ are conditionally independent of each other.
  * When generating a sentence, we need conditional dependence between words, eg: A-A and B-B might be valid, but A-B might be invalid.
* Completion:
  * Finish when input ends. This works for $x^{(t)} \rightarrow y^{(t)}$.
  * Extra output $y_\text{end}^{(t)}$ with the probability the output has completed.
  * Extra output $y_\text{length}^{(t)}$ with the length of output remaining/total.
* Optimization is done using the same gradient descent class of methods.
  * Gradients are calculated by expanding the recurrence to a flat formula, called back-propagation through time (BPTT).
* One difficult aspect of BPTT is the gradient $\Delta = \frac{\partial}{\partial s^t}$:
  * $\Delta > 0$: the state explodes, and provide unstable gradient. The solution is to clip the gradient updates to a reasonable size during descent.
  * $\Delta \approx 0$: this allows the state to persist for a long time, howevr the gradient descent method needs a gradient to work.
  * $\Delta < 0$: the RNN is in a constant state of information loss.
* There are variants of RNN that impose a simple prior to help preserve state $s^{(t)} \approx s^{(t-1)}$:
  * $s^{(t)} = f_t s^{(t-1)} + f(...)$: we get a direct first derivative $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$
  * It lets us pass along a gradient from previous steps, even when $f$ itself has zero gradient.
* Long short-term memory (LSTM) model input, output and forgetting:
  $s^{(t)} = f\_t s^{(t-1)} + i\_t f(s^{(t-1)}, x^{(t)}; \theta)$
  * The ouput is: $y^{(t)} = o\_t s^{(t)}$
  * It uses probabilities (known as gates): $o_t$ output, $f_t$ forgetting, $i_t$ input.
  * The gates are usually a sigmoid layer: $o_t = g(Mx+b) = \frac{1}{1+e^{Mx+b}}$.
  * Long term information is preserved, because generating new data $g$ and using it $i$ are decoupled.
  * Gradients are preserved more as there is a direct connection between the past and future.
* Gated recurrent unit (GRU) are a simpler model:
  $s^{(t)} = (1-u\_t)s^{(t-1)} + u\_tf(r_t s^{(t-1)}, x^{(t)}; \theta)$
  * The gates: $u_t$ update, $r_t$ reset.
  * There is no clear winner.
* For dropout, prefer $d(f(s, x; \theta))$ not storing information, over $d(s)$ losing information.
* Memory Networks and attention mechanisms.

## Useful Data Sets

* There are broad categories of input data, the applications are limitless.
* Images vector $[0-1]^{WH}$: image to label, image to description.
* Audio vector for each time slice: speech to text.
* Text embed each word into vector $[0-1]^N$: translation.
* Knowledge Graphs: question answering.

## Autoencoders

An autoencoder has two functions, which encode $f$ and decode $g$ from input space to representation space. The objective is:
$$ J = L(x, g(f(x))) $$

* $L$ is the loss function, and is low when images are similar.
* The idea is that the representation space learns important features.
* To prevent overfitting we have some additional regularization tools:
  * Sparse autoencoders minimize: $J' = J + S(f(x))$. This is a regularizer on representation space.
  * Denoising autoencoders minimize: $J = L(x, g(f(n(x))))$, where $n$ adds noise. This forces the network to differentiate noise from signal.
  * Contractive autoencoders minimize: $J' = J + \sum \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$. This forces the encoder to be smooth: similar inputs get similar outputs.
  * Predictive autoencoders: $J = L(x, g(h)) + L'(h, f(x))$. Instead of optimizing $g$ and $h$ simultaneously, optimize them alternately.
* Another solution is to train a discriminator network $D$ which outputs a scalar representing the probability the input is generated.

## Representation Learning

The idea is that instead of optimizing $ u = f(x; \theta) $, we optimize:
$$ u = r_o(f(r_i(x); \theta)) $$

* $r_i$ and $r_o$ are the input and output representations, but the idea can apply to CNN, RNN and other models.
  * For example the encoder half of an autoencoder can be used to represent the input $r_i$.
* The hope is that there are other representations that make the task easier.
* These representations can be trained on large amounts of data and understand the base data.
* For example: words is a very sparse input vector (all zeros, with one active).
  * There are semantic representations of words that is easier to work with.

## Practical Advice

* Have a good measure of your success.
* Build a working model as soon as possible.
* Instrument and iterate from data.

## Appendix: Probability

* Probability is a useful tool because it allows us to model:
  * Randomness: truely random system (quantum etc).
  * Hidden variables: deterministic, but we can't see all the critical factors.
  * Incomplete models: especially relevant in chaotic systems that are sensitive to small perturbations.
* It is useful for reading papers and more advanced machine learning, but not as critical for playing around with a network.
* Probability: $P(x,y)$ means $P(\text{x} = x, \text{y} = y)$.
* Marginal probability: $P(x) = \sum_y P(\text{x} = x, \text{y} = y)$.
* Chain rule: $P(x,y) = P(x|y)P(y)$.
* If $x$ and $y$ are independent: $P(x,y) = P(x)P(y)$.
* Expectation: $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim P}[f(x)] = \sum_x P(x)f(x)$.
* Bayes rule: $P(x|y) = \frac{P(x)P(y|x)}{P(y)} = \frac{P(x)P(y|x)}{\sum_x P(x)P(y|x)}$.
* Self information: $I(x) = -\log P(x)$.
* Shannon entropy: $H(x) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim P}[I(x)] = -\sum_x P(x) \log P(x)$.
* KL divergence: $D\_\text{KL}(P||Q) = \mathbb{E}\_{x \sim P}\big[\log\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\big]$.
  * It is a measure of how similar distributions $P$ and $Q$ are (not true measure, not symmetric).
* Cross entropy: $H(P,Q) = H(P) + D\_\text{KL} = -\mathbb{E}\_{x \sim P} \log Q(x)$.
* Maximum likelihood:
  * For $p$ is data and $q$ is model:
  * $\theta\_\text{ML} = \arg\max\_\theta Q(X; \theta)$.
  * Assuming iid and using log: $\theta\_\text{ML} = \arg\max\_\theta \sum\_x \log Q(x; \theta)$.
  * Since each data point is equally likely: $\theta\_\text{ML} = \arg\max\_\theta H(P, Q; \theta)$.
  * The only component of KL that varies is the entropy: $\theta\_\text{ML} = \arg\max\_\theta D\_\text{KL}(P||Q; \theta)$.
* Maximum a posteriori:
  * $\theta\_\text{MAP} = \arg\max\_\theta Q(\theta | X) = \arg\max\_\theta\log Q(X | \theta) + \log Q(\theta)$.
  * This is like a regularizing term based on the prior of $Q(\theta)$.
